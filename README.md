Go Telemetry Transport (mqtt client library for go)

This project is intended to be used as a general-purpose library for communication using the mqtt protocol as defined [here](http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/dw/webservices/ws-mqtt/mqtt-v3r1.html). 

Project Goals:
-------------

* strict adherence to the [MQTT Specification](http://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/dw/webservices/ws-mqtt/mqtt-v3r1.html)
* clean, expressive api
* api versioning where the spec changes
* built with testing in mind (broker mocking)
